Quirky is a simple, no frills WordPress theme that's based on Automattic's starter theme, [Underscores](https://underscores.me/).

Quirky looks something like this:

## Features

Here's a high level list of _some_ of the features included in Quirky (note: there's aren't many as it's deliberately slim):

* Fully responsive layout.
* Javascript free mobile menu.
* Unique brutalist style design, with a bit of whimsy.
* Custom fonts that **don't** use Google.
* Three widget areas in the footer.
